            This causes it to be processed as a string literal and expressions are then
            processed. As long as the block of code has access to the proper data object, 
            in this case "content", then the variables are injected into th template.
            The js... eval ...method is considered "unsafe."

            "type" attribute is set to "module". At the top of this code block, notice
            that there is an "import" statement. the function name matches the exported
            function from the JS import file. For this to work, you just call the function
            and pass it the data. Take a look at that JS file to understand how it needs to
            be setup in order to take in data and return the template literal string so it
            is processed natively by JavaScript without calling the risky eval method. The
            code here is also much shorter. You just have to remember to export the function
            and import it in the JS where you want to reuse it. You don't have to export a 
            function if you put all of your code in the same file, but the file will get more
            busy and less clear to read later.
