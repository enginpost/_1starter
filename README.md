This is where I start my ES6 projects with SCSS compiling, file watching, and browser_sync

## Steps to get started

1. Setup your own Git Repo using GitHub and make note of the repo name:
   (username/reponame) 
2. Clone this repo into a folder on your system
3. On the command line root of your local project, redirect the remote repository to the new repo you created in step 1:
   (git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git)
4. Push your new repo to github
3. Run "npm install"
4. Make changes
5. run "npm start" to beging watches, compiles and browser sync
6. commit your changes as you go to your new copy
